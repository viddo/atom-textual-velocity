## [unreleased]
#### Added
- Asynchronous initial scan of files
  - Number of files found indicated and updated continuously on initial scan, replacing the generic spinner
  - Fixes the issue of Atom being mostly unresponsive while scanning for files
  - Also fixed the rare case of a path containing "many files" causing Atom to actually freeze - no other reports of it, though

#### Changed
- :truck: Internal code overhaul
  - Migrated away from the ["VIP" architecture](http://clean-swift.com/clean-swift-ios-architecture/)+[BaconJS streams](http://baconjs.github.io/) to a more "contemporary" architecture consisting of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)+[Redux](redux.js.org)+[observables](https://redux-observable.js.org)
  - Code feels much "better" now and easier to maintain, which should make it easier for people to understand the code base and contribute :rocket:
-  :arrow_up: Updated all dependencies to latest stable verisons

#### Fixed
- Key down/up on empty list not throwing errors

#### Removed
- Now unused dependencies (lodash.debounce, baconjs)
